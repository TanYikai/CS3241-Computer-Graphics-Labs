This time im making an abstract art! Since this is the final lab, 
lets play a mini guessing game! Can you guess how many hidden mickey are there in the scene when "s" is first pressed?
definitions: Hidden mickey are 3 circles that can form a sillouette of an iconic mickey mouse head, they can overlap and the 3 circles 
need not be joined together!

The answer is revealed at the bottom. (scroll down)

******************Extra Feature*******************
1)Shadow
2)Cube (or cuboid in this case)

































***********Answer to the mini guessing game**************************
Did you guessed it? The answer is as many as EYE can see! 
That's right! Much like any abstract art pieces, there are no right answers or wrong or one answer, it all depends on how you perceive it!

Well its been fun making labs, thank you for marking and hope you have a nice day ahead, or a good night rest! untill next time - signing out
