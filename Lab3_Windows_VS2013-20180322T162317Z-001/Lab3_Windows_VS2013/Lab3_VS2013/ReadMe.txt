Hi, this time I am making 2 game characters from a very special childhood of mine, could you guess what it is? It is non other than the
popular fun filled ...

***Primtives Used***
GL_TRIANGLE_FAN


The first composite model(scene 3) is dubbed edible while the second (scene 4) green/yellow composite model is dubbed not edible!

If you press 'd' on the scene number 4, the characters will do a little dance under the spotlight, you can even press 'c' to switch colour scheme
while dancing to the beat haha
If you press 'D' on the scene number 4, the characters will do Dynamic pounce towards the unsuspecting viewers

***Extra features***
1)when 'd' is pressed, the characters are animated or dance 
2)when 'd' is pressed, the light will move and rotate
3)when 'D' is pressed, the angle of the camera is animated to give the illusion of dynamic pouncing

Hoped you enjoyed it as much I did making it! Till next time!
